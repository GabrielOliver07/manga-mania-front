## Technical Requirements

- 1.Have a SPA frontend, built with React, consisting of multiple views and implementing all CRUD actions.
- 2.Have a REST API backend built with ExpressJS, MongoDB and Mongoose, that your React app will communicate with.
- 3.Have a REST API backend with routes that perform all CRUD actions for at least one model (excluding the users model).
- 4.Have 3 database models or more. Having one model for users is the first step. The other two (or more) models should represent the main functionality of your app.

- 7.Have at least 2 commits per day that you worked on.
- 8.Have a backend validation and centralized error handling in your REST API.
- 9.Be deployed online, allowing anyone to access and use your app.
